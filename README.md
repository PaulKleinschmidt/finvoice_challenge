# Finvoice Code Challenge

The repo contains my submission to the Finvoice Rails API code challenge.

## Requirements

- Ruby version 2.7.0 or later

## Quick Start

Run the following commands to run the project locally

```
bundle install
rails s
```

## Tests

Run `rspec` in the project root to run the test suite. I used the following gems to help with writing tests:

- factory_bot_rails
- rails-controller-testing
- shoulda-matchers
- faker
